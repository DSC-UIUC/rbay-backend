1.	When I tried to signUp with wrong val for is_student, I got an error, 
	but a user document was still created. So when I tried again with 
	correct is_student, it said user already exists. User document should be made at the end.

2.	I deleted the user doc. Then it said email already exists :(

3.	Delete requests are usually not allowed to have a body?

4.	<h1>Error: Forbidden</h1>
