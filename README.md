# Research Bay: Backend
You'll be focusing on what the user can't see! This involves working with Firebase, GCP, etc to build much of the supporting functionalities of the web app, including working with databases, API endpoints, and user authentication. This will be a serverless backend (i.e. lives on a cloud platform). This role will also involve fullstack work (i.e. connecting the frontend to the backend via a REST API over HTTP).
